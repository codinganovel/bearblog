# Session 2: Personal CMS Debugging and Architecture Fix

## Overview
Fixed critical issues in the bearblog-to-personal-cms transformation. The admin page works, but after logging in, both homepage and dashboard broke again.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. URL Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: Dashboard views expected `subdomain` parameters but URLs didn't provide them
- **Fix**: Updated all URL patterns in `blogs/urls.py` to remove `id` parameters
- **Files Modified**: `blogs/urls.py`

### 2. View Function Architecture Mismatch
- **Problem**: All dashboard views still used multi-user logic with `blog.user` references
- **Fix**: Updated all view functions to use single-blog architecture with `get_blog()` helper
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `blogs/views/dashboard.py`
  - `blogs/views/studio.py` 
  - `blogs/views/media.py`

**Key Changes Made:**
```python
# OLD (multi-user)
@login_required
def nav(request, id):
    if request.user.is_superuser:
        blog = get_object_or_404(Blog, subdomain=id)
    else:
        blog = get_object_or_404(Blog, user=request.user, subdomain=id)

# NEW (single-blog)
@login_required
def nav(request):
    blog = get_blog()
```

### 3. Template References to Removed Fields
- **Problem**: Templates referenced `blog.user.settings.upgraded` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Updated all template references to work without user model
- **Files Modified**:
  - `templates/home.html`
  - `templates/post.html` 
  - `templates/posts.html`
  - `templates/snippets/dashboard_nav.html`

**Template Changes:**
```html
<!-- OLD -->
{% if blog.user.settings.upgraded %}{{ blog.header_directive | safe }}{% endif %}

<!-- NEW -->
{{ blog.header_directive | safe }}
```

### 4. Template Tag Issues
- **Problem**: Custom template tags in `blogs/templatetags/custom_tags.py` referenced `blog.user`
- **Fix**: Removed upgrade restrictions and user references
- **Files Modified**: `blogs/templatetags/custom_tags.py`

### 5. Database Migration Issues
- **Problem**: Old database had conflicting model structure
- **Solution**: Complete database reset
  1. Killed server
  2. `rm -f db.sqlite3`
  3. `find blogs/migrations -name "*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete`
  4. `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
  5. `python3 manage.py migrate`
  6. Created fresh superuser

### 6. Missing Model Properties
- **Problem**: Templates expected domain properties that didn't exist
- **Fix**: Added missing properties to Blog model
- **Files Modified**: `blogs/models.py`

```python
@property
def useful_domain(self):
    return "http://localhost:8000"

@property
def dynamic_useful_domain(self):
    return "http://localhost:8000"

@property
def blank_useful_domain(self):
    return "localhost:8000"
```

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Server starts without errors
- Home page loads: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Admin interface: `http://localhost:8000/admin/` 
- Superuser login: `admin` / `admin123`
- Fresh database with clean single-blog architecture

### ❌ Current Problem
After logging into the admin page, both homepage and dashboard are broken again.

### Error Investigation Needed
1. Check what happens when user authentication state changes
2. Possible issues with:
   - Session middleware
   - Authentication-dependent view logic
   - Template rendering with authenticated user context
   - Missing user-related model properties

### Files Requiring Further Investigation
- Views that handle authenticated vs anonymous users differently
- Templates that show different content based on `request.user`
- Any remaining references to user settings or multi-user logic

## Architecture Changes Summary

### Before (Multi-user BearBlog)
- Multiple blogs per user
- `Blog.user` foreign key relationship
- `UserSettings` model for upgrades/limits
- Subdomain-based routing
- Complex authentication logic

### After (Single-user Personal CMS)  
- Single blog instance
- No user relationship on Blog model
- No upgrade restrictions
- Simple routing without parameters
- Simplified authentication

## Next Session Tasks
1. Investigate why login breaks homepage/dashboard
2. Check for remaining authentication-dependent code
3. Test all dashboard functionality when logged in
4. Ensure post creation/editing works
5. Verify media upload functionality
6. Test theme customization

## Technical Debt
- Some studio.py functions still have unused subscription logic
- Media upload functionality may need S3 credentials removed
- Email signup functionality needs to be tested
- RSS feed generation needs verification

## Development Environment
- Python 3.9.6
- Django 4.2.23
- SQLite database (fresh)
- Server: `python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
- Admin: admin/admin123
