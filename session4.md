# Session 4: Dashboard fixes and email-service removal plan

## What I changed in this session

- Fixed template reversals that crashed the dashboard when authenticated (NoReverseMatch for `email_list` and `account`).
  - Added simplified email endpoints to `blogs/urls.py`:
    - `dashboard/emails/` -> `email_list`
    - `subscribe/`, `subscribe/new/`, `subscribe/confirm/` -> simple placeholder views in `blogs/views/emailer.py`.
  - Added an `account` view in `blogs/views/dashboard.py` that redirects to the Django admin index and mapped it to `account/` in `blogs/urls.py`.

- Re-tested the dashboard via the dev server: the `/dashboard/` page now renders (HTTP 200). The dashboard UI functions except the nested subpages for `posts` and `pages` (these still require QA).

## Current status (manual verification)

- Admin UI: Works and you can log in (admin/admin123).
- Home page: Loads.
- Dashboard main page: Loads and is functional (editing the header body, saving, uploading media, styles preview).
- Dashboard features that work: nav, posts list rendering, theme selection, media upload (editor upload target configured), settings.
- Dashboard features still to verify: the `pages` and `posts` subpages and their edit flows â€” they render but need manual QA for create/edit/delete flows and correct URL reversals where `uid` or `id` were used previously.

## Recommendation: remove email service entirely

Rationale: the personal CMS should not include the multi-tenant email subscription system used in BearBlog (it adds complexity and external dependencies). I recommend removing it in these steps:

1. Remove email-related routes and placeholder views if you don't intend to reintroduce them. Delete `blogs/views/emailer.py` or leave it if you want minimal placeholder pages.
2. Remove templates related to email subscription: `templates/subscribe.html` (and any dashboard email templates) or keep a single static page that explains email subscriptions are not supported.
3. Clean up references in templates and template tags (e.g. `{{ email-signup }}` replacements are safe to keep as they are harmless but remove their rendering if you remove the templates).
4. Remove any email-related forms, models, and migrations (`Subscriber`, `UserSettings` if still present) to reduce db clutter.
5. Update `README.md` and `session` notes to indicate email subscriptions are intentionally not supported in the Personal CMS.

## Next steps I can take now (pick any)

- Remove the email service code and templates automatically.
- Run through a manual QA checklist for `posts` and `pages` (create, edit, publish, delete, preview) and fix any remaining URL reversals.
- Tidy up leftover imports and unused code (optional).
