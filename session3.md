# Session 3: Remove remaining multi-user logic and finalize Personal CMS refactor

## Summary of work

- Searched the codebase for leftover multi-user patterns (`blog.user`, `request.user.settings`, `request.user.blogs`, `UserSettings`, upgrade logic) and removed or adapted them for the single-blog personal CMS.
- Replaced template references that used `request.user.settings.*` with site-level includes (`snippets/styles.html`) or `blog` fields such as `blog.footer_directive`.
- Updated view functions to rely on `get_blog()` singleton helper and removed redirects/logic that required `id=blog.subdomain` parameters.
- Removed upgrade gating (redirects to `upgrade`) and exposed functionality directly since the personal CMS has no upgrade tiers.

## Files changed (high level)

- `blogs/views/studio.py` — removed references to `blog.user.settings` gating, simplified list/create flow to personal CMS, adjusted redirects and removed upvote creation on new posts.
- `blogs/views/dashboard.py` — removed user deletion logic and ensured views use `get_blog()` and single-blog URLs.
- `blogs/views/signup_flow.py` — adjusted signup to create/reuse single Blog instance and redirect to dashboard without `id` parameter.
- `blogs/templatetags/custom_tags.py` — removed upgrade restrictions and ensured markdown/email-signup injection works for personal CMS.
- Templates updated: many files under `templates/studio/` and `templates/dashboard/` and `templates/account/` — removed `request.user.settings.*` and `request.user.blogs` usage, replaced style includes with `{% include 'snippets/styles.html' with blog=blog %}`, removed upgrade flows and `id=blog.subdomain` URL parameters where appropriate.
- `templates/snippets/editor_functions.html` — enabled uploads for personal CMS (removed upgrade prompt) and updated upload target URL to non-subdomain form.

## What I removed or changed

- All upgrade gating (checks against `request.user.settings.upgraded` / `blog.user.settings.upgraded`) so pages and features are accessible to the admin of the single blog.
- Template references to `request.user.settings.dashboard_styles` and `request.user.settings.dashboard_footer` — replaced with `snippets/styles.html` and `blog.footer_directive`.
- URL patterns in templates that passed `id=blog.subdomain` to dashboard routes — templates now use simple URL names (e.g. `{% url 'posts_edit' %}`) suitable for single-blog routes.
- Multi-blog listing and creation logic in `studio.list` was replaced with a redirect to the dashboard/studio since only one blog exists.

## Next steps / manual checks

1. Run the development server and try the following flows:
   - Log in to admin and confirm the homepage and all dashboard pages render correctly.
   - Create/edit posts and pages; test uploads via the editor.
   - Test `signup_flow` if that route is used for onboarding in your deployment.
2. Run your test suite (if any) and run full linter/formatter across the repo.
3. Optional: Clean up unused imports and remove the `UserSettings` model and related migrations if not already deleted.

## Notes

- I left in `session2.md` and `whatidid.md` records — you can now delete or archive other multi-tenant artifacts as desired.
- If you want, I can now run the dev server (`python3 manage.py runserver`) and reproduce the earlier login break to confirm the fix end-to-end.
